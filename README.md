# Optimized-Particle-System

Optimized existing particle system as a final project for Optimezed C++ class.  Made particle system 1.8x faster.
Using the following techniques to improve system:
- Data caching and alignment
- Return Value Optimization (RVO)
- Memory Allocation optimizations
- Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)
